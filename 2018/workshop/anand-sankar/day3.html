						The day started with a small session where we had to interview three people from different teams, and also get interviewed by three people. I got caught up in all the fun and ended up interviewing six people and got interviewed by four. It was a memorable activity because it took me a few takes to figure out a proper interview format and also made the interviewee feel relaxed enough to speak casually.</br></br>

We decided on naming our team the “The C-team”, simple (and seemingly uninspired but I actually put a lot of thought into it) but we came up with a punny motto “because everything else is underwater”, because everything else is ‘below C-level’ (bad pun, but it works.) </br> I designed out logo to look like a 3D printer as well.</br></br>

(You can view this and all the stuff I've made during the entire course of TechTop 2018 by <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bWmDN9eeGJYalmgFuBDvP-uF8G927wPX?usp=sharing">clicking here</a>)</br> </br>

Rajesh sir got us started us on Design thinking with a small seminar afterwards, and we learned some important principles, namely: Learning from people, Finding patterns, Designing principles, Making it tangible and finally, to Iterate relentlessly.</br></br>

After the first presentation, We had another presentation by Dr. Savitha Ramaswamy, A data scientist who works with AI, especially with Neural networks and Machine Learning in Singapore at the Institute for Infocomm Research and Development. She talked about how neural networks are helping doctors to treat patients more efficiently, and told us about how some real-life implemented systems work; I personally found that presentation really interesting because of how detailed  the presentation was.</br></br>

After Lunch, we had a field trip and we had no idea where exactly we were going and when we reached our destination, we found out that it was a small farm of a few hundred square feet, and had a few cows and some crops.</br></br>

The visit piqued my curiosity because beyond the general farm and its produce, there were a lot of other things to observe, a traditional ‘there’s more to it than meets the eye’ scenario.</br></br>

The farm was run by Gautam, a Computer Science Major who stopped pursuing a career in his field and went on to follow his passion and start the farm. We found out that Gautam is the son of the Registrar of Kalasalingam University.</br></br>

The farm mainly to breeds local cow breeds, which provide A2 milk. The classification of milk as A1 and A2 is based on the type of beta-casein present in the milk. We learned about the prime benefits of A2 milk; A2 Milk is produced by local cow breeds while, most european/exotic breeds such as Jersey produce A1 milk. A1 milk is produced in large quantities (upto 70 litres per cow) but does not have a lot of health benefits, and according to the registrar, often times actually cause more harm than good, while A2 milk, made by local cow breeds, tend to be produced in lesser quantities (upto 15-20 litres) but at the same time, have a lot of health benefits, protein and vitamins.</br></br>

The cows are very meticulously maintained in the farm and I learned more about cows than I ever thought I needed to know including their diet, schedules, and after one of us asked a question about cow dung, I was ‘blessed’ with a 15 minute lecture on cow poop. Very explicit and informative, that.</br></br>

Raj told us to look around and see if there are any problems or any things we observed that could use improvements, and just general observation; I noticed a lot of plastic around the compound, small kinds which seemingly pose no threat, but could become an issue if left unchecked. There were two workers hired to construct a cement wall around the compound, which some of us mistook for the farm workers.</br></br>

I asked the registrar about how they manage to maintain cattle feed, and he said that since the local cow breeds eat upto a whopping 30 kg of grass a day, and they’re fed a specific type of grass known as Super Napier Grass, which grows upto 7 feet, and grow within 9-12 days, and planted strategically, to maximize efficiency, he also uses Hydroponics.</br></br>

Under a small makeshift tent, we found a sleeping puppy, who later woke up and as following me and my friend, Anuvind around for a while. Gautam later told us that the pupper was called Tony. and Anuvind managed to take a lot of candid pictures of me while I was picking up Tony, and I have to either thank Anuvind’s phone camera or his surprisingly good photography skills, or both.</br></br>



There was another compound right outside the farm which contained another small cultivation, and used flood irrigation, something which I found quite surprising (even Raj pointed it out later when we went back), since Tamil Nadu has huge water shortages. There was room for improvement there.</br></br>
</br>
<img src="img/bg-img/day3/farm5.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Image" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 0px solid #000000;"> 

While most people were looking at the farm, I was more interested in the flora and fauna surrounding the area; the actual ecosystem of the location and the things out there that people don't notice as easily I was able to identify about a dozen species of small shrubs and grasses that are accustomed to grow in drier climates. I found evidence and samples of various insects, which feed on these shrubs and also prey on each other, most notably Antlions.

</br> </br>  Antlion larvae are known to make sand pit traps, in drier climates. There were sand pits in a lot of places outside the compound, as well as abandoned termite mounds. Termite mounds are destroyed and the mixture of materials (digested plant material, faeces, and soil) are used as manure for plants. The indication of all these different insects and tiny plants solidified that the ecosystem was thriving in the generally dry climate near the farm, something which I’ve learned about countless times, but still managed to amaze me. </br></br>

I also found a small ferrite piece in a small formation of iron ore, which I took with me as both a souvenir and a research sample.</br></br>

After we came back to the Kalasalingam university campus, we were taken to this special building where they teach and train blind/partially blind people how to use computers which would enable them to work even with their handicaps.</br></br>

We were all split into different groups and we were talking to different people who were undergoing training there.

Me, Rhutwik and Nithin (Rhutwik’s teammate from Team D) talked to Mr. Dineshkumar, who is 90% blind but can faintly recognize shapes and shadows, and he talked about his line of work.



Mr. Dineshkumar has been in training for about 4 months and he’s learned how to type and operate the computer and the GUI without the need of a screen using a narration software for the blind called Nvda. He said that after he became blind because of a genetic condition in his late 20s, he stayed home for over 2 years without doing anything and it really sucked out his motivation to get back into life, but then he heard about this teaching course and he thought he’d give it a shot and now he says he’s never had to look back since then. He’s adept at using most computer operations like using a browser, sending emails, and using office tools such as Microsoft Word and Excel.

He even sent us all an email. It was interesting to see these men and their zeal to get back into work and become even more useful than their sighted counterparts, doing officework.</br>
</br>
After our small but very interesting detour, we got back to the lab and had a small session on design thinking again by Raj and then we had a ‘speed dating’-inspired game where we were meeting and interacting with everyone with one minute time limits before we move on to the next person.
