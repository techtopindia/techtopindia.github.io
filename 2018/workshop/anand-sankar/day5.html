Day Five started out really fast. We began to finalize on a problem, and make a product to tackle the problem and find a solution. My team settled on safety issues for the workers in the spinning mill, because of my personal experience with the cotton fibre getting in my eye as well as the lack of masks and safety equipment worn by the workers, plus their feedback on why they weren’t using them. </br></br>

Aathikesava from my team told us that when he asked a worker why they weren’t wearing safety masks, they said ‘our predecessors never wore equipment so why should we?’ leading us to realize that one of the issues was a lack of safety awareness as well. So we started fast, and decided to make an all-inclusive safety system. One of them being the extensive promotion of safety awareness by putting up attractive looking posters all throughout the spinning mill, so that at least at some point, workers will take notice, and just it’s mere presence serves as a passive reminder and becomes normalized over time.</br></br>

I also thought about another instance where a worker told me why he wasn’t wearing gloves (which prevent microfibres from getting stuck anywhere), he said that he has to feel the cotton physically to check its quality and the gloves are too thick, so I thought of making a modification to their gloves as well. </br></br>

The workers didn’t like masks because it hindered their breathing, and felt uncomfortable, so we needed to work on addressing that, we thought of making some sort of mask which has safety properties but without compromising on comfort. So we thought maybe a type of safety glasses plus a comfortable mask would work (we ended up changing this design in the end)</br></br>

The dress code of the workers in the mill was also haphazard, and some female workers were wearing sarees, and clothing which has some bits sticking out, which is a major safety hazard, should any of the ‘sticking out bits’ get stuck in a machine. So we needed to come up with a practical, yet comfortable style of uniforms.</br></br>

Aathikesava and Diwakar from our team had to leave in between because they were working on another project to present to Raj later, so it was just me and Anand working. I was drawing concepts and mockup designs while Anand was helping out other teams with their work. We had to make a specified problem statement and pitch our idea to the rest of the participants and get feedback.</br></br>

We presented our ideas and I got the idea, of combining the glasses and mask idea, simplifying both; I thought why not make glasses, which produced a wall of air downwards in front of the face, so that all the cotton is directed downwards (which would be cleaned up by systems already in place which vacuum the fibres and reuse them, so as to prevent wastage), our idea was well received and we got to work.</br></br>

I thought i’d be cool if i could 3D print the frame for the glasses, so I got to work, and I was feeling lazy so here’s what I did:</br></br>
I got a glasses icon after a google image search, went on Adobe Illustrator and vectorized it, and then imported it to Fusion 360 (I tried sketchup at first but then I switched to 360 later) and extruded it and designed the rest of it</br></br>

I added hinges based on a simple removable design and I took a big leap of faith and thought I should test it out.</br></br>

The first attempt failed, the software for the printer, UP Studio couldn’t simulate the support structures properly so I had to reposition the hinges and make some changes, and after some changes, I tried again, and it worked!</br></br>

</br> </br>

As soon as people saw the frame, everyone suddenly got interested and wanted to take pictures with it and that was really fun! </br>

After I finished drawing the rest of the concepts and mockups, and finalized the basic design of the frame, which by now we were dubbing it ‘project airframe’; we needed to figure out a way to make the ‘wall of air’ in front of the frame, as in a system to push air through small tubes located on the frame; we needed an impeller, a.k.a an air blower.</br></br>

Anand Joshi first tried to make a makeshift impeller from a bunch of paper cups and some metal, but that was taking too long, so I decided to see if i can 3D print my own, and after a few failed and partially successful attempts and a few hours later after midnight, I decided to check the web to look for open source files, and I found a file for an industrial sized blower, so i took some time to scale it down to something palm-sized, and simplified the design, and tried to test it out. To my surprise, it worked REALLY WELL! There was a small issue with friction from the impeller inside the casing, but that was fixed after a few adjustments, so then all we needed to do was add the tubing and air flow system to the frame. </br></br>

By the time I was printing the Impeller, it was already about 04:00 AM(technically Day 6) so most people went to sleep a long time ago, but then we had a few people still working at the lab as well as a few mentors, including ANOTHER Anand: Anand Parikh, a really awesome and chill guy, who I met the day before, and he was working on his own product which he patented, a device which helps surgeons reconnect severed blood vessels more easily.</br></br>
